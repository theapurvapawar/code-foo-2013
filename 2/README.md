Gamers in San Francisco Bay Area
=============

1. The question is ambiguous. There's no data provided to interpret and/or analyse.

2. Data assumed -
>	1. SF Bay Area - Population Density - 395.29/sq. km. (Wikipedia)
>	2. SF Bay Area - Area - 18088 sq. km. (Wikipedia)
>	3. USA Gamer Population 2012 - 221.5 million (NPD Group)
>	4. USA Population 2012 - 315.7 million (Wikipedia - rounded off) 

3. Calculating the percentage of population in USA that plays video games -
>	1. Percentage of gamers in USA = (221.5 / 315.7) * 100
> 	2. Percentage of gamers in USA = 70.16 % (rounded off)

4. This gives us the average percentage of gamers in USA. Using this, we can evaluate the number of gamers in San Francisco Bay Area.

5. We know it's population density, hence we can get the number of gamers per sq. km. too -
>	1. Gamer Density in SF Bay Area = 70.16% of SF Bay Area Population Density
>	2. Gamer Density in SF Bay Area = 256.29/sq. km. (rounded off)

6. Multiplying the Density by Area will give the gamer population -
>	1. Gamer Population in SF Bay Area = Gamer Density in SF Bay Area * Total Area of SF Bay Area
>	2. Gamer Population in SF Bay Area = 256.29/sq. km. * 18088 sq. km.
>	3. Gamer Population in SF Bay Area = 4635728 (rounded off)

7. Adding a tolerance of plus/minus 5% for any errors/rounding off/economics etc. -
>	1. Min = 4403941 (rounded off)
>	2. Max = 4867514 (rounded off)

Last words -

The overall data of USA population and its gamer population is processed and used to estimate the gamer population in SF Bay Area. Note that, I've used the Population Density and not the Population itself to evaluate. Start small, go big.

Final answer -

If I have to provide a range, the number of gamers in San Francisco Bay Area would be from 4.40 million to 4.87 million. (heavily rounded off)

And if I have to submit one single value, it would be 4635728 or 4.64 million.
