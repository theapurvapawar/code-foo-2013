Word Search
=============

Implemented in HTML and javascript.

Simply open the 'wordsearch.html' page in a browser to run the program.

Make sure 'wordsearch.js' is in the same directory as 'wordsearch.html'

Tested on Google Chrome

Last words -
-------------

Basic question has been answered, but

1. Could've done a better job by recursively using a single search function with search direction as parameter to the function. More thought, Less code.

2. Did not care for any CSS styling on the HTML even though it's right up my alley.

Although I wanted to cover the above two points, a time constraint makes me stop and continue to the next question. Will revisit if I have time left. 



Notes to myself -

Error on 'score' --> check for double 's' input --> solved

plasmid --> not found (intentionally put?)

would you kindly, Xin Zhao --> check for spaces --> solved

words go from -

	left to right
	right to left
	top to bottom
	bottom to top
	top left to bottom right diagonally
