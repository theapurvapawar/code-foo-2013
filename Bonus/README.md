Space Invaders - The Game
=============
>
>There are a lot of tools available which help you construct a game within minutes, I hope thats not the method expected.
>
>I have no prior experience in game development, but I do theorotically know a few tricks.
>
>For example - I could use sprites for all the visual objects in the game. Classic games have used sprites in plenty.
>
>Although their usage in games might be less today, but sprites today have taken over the web.
>
>Many websites use sprites today to load images. They adjust the position per image using CSS.
>
>Coming back to the game, collision detection is the major aspect of the game, where -
>
> 1. If the player hits the alien, then the alien dies
> 2. If the alien hits the player, the player dies.
> 3. If the alien hits the obstruction/barricade, it falls apart piece by piece.
> 4. The game ends if all aliens die, or if the player dies.
>
>
>Other than this, there is a logic for movement and score.
